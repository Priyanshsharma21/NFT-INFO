1. What is react native ? 
First we know react is a javascript liberary to build beautiful UI using  reuseable component based architucture

2. native bhaisahab is js framework which is used to  real native  mobile application for android and ios

3. Like react but use native components rather than web components
4. Code written in js but code compiled in native code
Native code is computer code compiled to run with particular preprocessor

Scenario ->
->We write code in c++ this is written in english (hhl) goes to preprocessor and all white space and comments removed
->Now this will pass from compiler 7 different phases and compile to assemble language(language which is not completly machine and not completly human understandable)
-> Now this assembly lang will pass from assembler to convert to machine code 

Macine is OS + Microprocessor = platform

Scanario->
some language like java and js or react native this dont have compiler thay have virtual machine which convert this code into native code which can be undersytand by platform

If we have AMD native code will be understand by it
If we have intel native code will be understand by it microprocessor

Native code translate to machine code


To baccho humne kya sikha
C++ like language are microprocessor specific
Java is generalized

hance c c++ will run on some microprocessor , if mp changes then new interface provided to it which will do all the process again

In java or js or react native code convert to native code which can be run in different platfoerms 


This happens in react native case


1. Features -> Reactive native is cross platform
2. Code convet to Native code hance performance in all the platforms are same
3. Hot reloading
4. Large community
5. Have there own native Conmponents like Head, View, text
div-----------> View

All the code in view or native component will be converted to native code not our logic in js
Views----> compiled to --------> Native widgets
JS --> kept as js code

this js will send to virtiual machine
